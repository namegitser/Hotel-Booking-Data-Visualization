This project presents an insightful analysis of hotel booking data, utilizing both MS SQL and POWERBI for data processing and visualization. By examining key aspects of the data, the project aims to provide actionable insights for optimizing revenue and guest experiences.

-----------------Requirements:

1)Annual Revenue Growth: The analysis aims to determine whether the hotel's revenue has been growing yearly, taking into consideration the presence of two types of hotels.

2)Parking Lot Expansion: The project evaluates the necessity of increasing parking lot size by investigating trends in guest preferences regarding personal vehicles.

3)Trend Identification: Through data visualization, the project seeks to identify trends within the booking data that could impact decision-making.

------------------Procedure:

The project begins with a comprehensive data cleaning process, ensuring accurate and reliable insights. It then focuses on analyzing the data for each type of hotel individually. The assessment of parking lot size necessity involves understanding guest behavior related to personal vehicles. The data retrieval and analysis process is conducted in MS SQL Server, ensuring flexibility based on the user's expertise and requirements.

-------------------Findings:

1)Revenue Insights: The revenue trends for consecutive years are as follows: 2018-2019 ($1.64M), 2019-2020 ($6.62M), and 2020-2021 ($3.96M). Notably, the revenue for 2020-2021 exhibited a significant decrease, largely attributed to the COVID-19 epidemic.
